            <h1>Best Selling Flowers Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>What are the best selling flowers?</h2>
            <p>Picking the best flowers to have delivered for your special occasion depends on a variety of factors,
                including
                what message you want them to relay, why you're sending them, and how long you want them to last. That
                said,
                some of our top-selling flowers year-round include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Roses</li>
                <li>Lilies</li>
                <li>Carnations</li>
                <li>Daisies</li>
                <li>Sunflowers</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Our website is easy to navigate so you can shop flowers by color, flower type, or occasion to find the
                best
                bouquet for your needs. When you choose your best selling flower bouquet, you can have it sent to your
                home,
                office, or directly to the recipient’s door.</p>
            <h2>How to choose the best flower arrangement?</h2>
            <p>Choosing the best arrangements starts by ordering from a high-quality flower delivery service like FTD.
                That
                way,
                you can rest assured that your delivery will arrive in beautiful condition and always on time. Once
                you've
                found
                a reliable source, you should think about the person you're sending them to and why, so you can pick the
                best
                flower bouquet for the occasion. You'll also want to find out if the type of flower you want to send is
                in
                season. After you've chosen the best bloom, many offerings allow you to choose to send your flowers with
                or
                without a variety of vases. Last but certainly not least, you can often select the size of your bouquet,
                which
                usually come in Standard, Deluxe, and Premium versions.</p>
